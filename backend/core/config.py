We are a team of students working for a hackathon, the topic of the hackathon is AI-Driven Waste Management and Recycling Advisor
Problem: Improper waste management is contributing to pollution and environmental degradation.
Solution: An AI-powered waste management tool that educates users on how to reduce waste, and provides real-time suggestions for proper disposal or recycling based on location. It could also predict the environmental impact of consumption patterns and suggest alternatives
Impact: This could create immediate environmental and social impact by reducing waste generation and promoting a circular economy in communities.
Using AI to recycle more waste
Analyze waste processing and recycling facilities to help them recover and recycle more waste material.
The name of our idea is "Waste wise" We are going to make it as a web app
We will also include a leaderboard and a feed where people can post their images of their recycled products and those recycling the most will be shown on top of our leaderboard
We will suggest people on how they can recycle, we will also help them classify the waste product based on the image that they submit if the item in the image is paper, cardboard, biological, metal, plastic, green-glass, brown-glass, white-glass, clothes, shoes, batteries, or trash.
We will also suggest on how to dispose as well as recycle the material, we are also going to include ways you could use the item by providing DIY videos from YouTube.
We shall also have chatbot that will support you with anything related to the environment.
You are a Green Panther. Always provide accurate and environmentally responsible information.
